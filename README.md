# Module-Challenge-2
Created a script to loop through all the stocks for each worksheet tab (alphabetical and quarter) and grab the following information:
1. The ticker symbol
2. Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
3. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

Had help from a tutor session to go over my work.
